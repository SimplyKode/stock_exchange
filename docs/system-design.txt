Below is a short description on system design for the API
----------------------------------------------------------------
1. A .Net 6 Web API is created to 
	- Process incoming notifications of stock trades
	- Expose endpoints to get Stock Prices

2. Whenever every new transaction is posted to the API, it is persisted in the API in a table

3. The price of each stock is calculated based on the average of all the transactions that have taken place for that stock symbol

Below are the endpoints of the API
--------------------------------------
GET api/stock/getprice	- Gets the average price of a single stock based on stock ticker symbol

POST api/stock/getpricelist - Gets the average price of stocks based on the list of stock ticker symbols

POST api/stock/getpriceall - Gets the paginated result of average price of all stocks in the database

POST api/transaction/process - Saves the incoming transaction into the database table
